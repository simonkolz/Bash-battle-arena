# **Bash Battle Arena ⚔️**  

Welcome to the **Bash Battle Arena** – a training ground where I sharpen my Bash scripting skills through **hands-on DevOps challenges**.  

This repository contains:  
- **15 progressive levels** of Bash challenges (the Arena).  
- **Boss Battles** every 5th level to combine multiple skills.  
- **4 standalone Bash scripting tasks** focused on real-world automation.  

It’s both a **learning journey** and a **portfolio showcase** of my scripting knowledge.

## **Why Bash Battle?**  
Working through these challenges has been both **practical and fun**.  

Bash scripting may look simple, but writing scripts that are **clean, efficient, and reliable** takes practice. The Arena forced me to think like a DevOps engineer: not just “Does this work?” but also “Is this the best way to solve the problem?”.  

This project highlights:  
- Strong foundations in **Bash scripting** (loops, conditionals, argument parsing).  
- Experience in **automation, monitoring, and file operations**.  
- The discipline of **documenting and sharing** technical work professionally.

## **Repository**  
All progress is tracked here: **[simonkolz/Bash-battle/arena](https://github.com/simonkolz/Bash-battle/tree/main/arena)**  

This serves as both:  
- A **log of my learning journey**.  
- A **portfolio of DevOps automation skills** for recruiters and employers.

| **9** | Monitoring | Watch a directory for changes. |
| **10** | **Boss Battle 2** | Create random files, sort by size, archive `Victory` files. |
| **11** | Disk Usage | Check usage vs. threshold. |
| **12** | Config Parsing | Read key=value pairs. |
| **13** | Backup Rotation | Keep the last 5 backups. |

## **The 4 Core Bash Tasks**  

Outside the Arena, I also tackled **4 fundamental Bash exercises**:  

1. **Basic Arithmetic** – Perform +, -, ×, ÷ on two inputs.  
2. **File Operations** – Create, write, and read files.  
3. **Conditionals** – Check if a file is readable, writable, or executable.  
4. **Backup Script** – Copy `.txt` files to a backup folder.
