Bash Battle Arena ⚔️

Welcome to the Bash Battle Arena – a training ground where I sharpen my Bash scripting skills through hands-on DevOps challenges.

This repository contains:

15 progressive levels of Bash challenges (the Arena).

Boss Battles every 5th level to combine multiple skills.

4 standalone Bash scripting tasks focused on real-world automation.

It’s both a learning journey and a portfolio showcase of my scripting knowledge.

Why Bash Battle?

Working through these challenges has been both practical and fun.

Bash scripting may look simple, but writing scripts that are clean, efficient, and reliable takes practice. The Arena forced me to think like a DevOps engineer: not just “Does this work?” but also “Is this the best way to solve the problem?”.

This project highlights:

Strong foundations in Bash scripting (loops, conditionals, argument parsing).

Experience in automation, monitoring, and file operations.

The discipline of documenting and sharing technical work professionally.

Arena Structure 

The Arena has 15 levels, each focusing on a specific concept.
Every 5th level is a Boss Battle where multiple skills are tested together.

⚠️ All challenges are solved locally (no web app). Each solution is pushed here to GitHub.

Level Progression
Level	Topic	Mission
1	Basics	Create a directory Arena with 3 files and list contents.
2	Loops	Print numbers 1–10.
3	Conditionals	Check if hero.txt exists.
4	File Ops	Copy .txt files to Backup.
5	Boss Battle 1	Combine Levels 1–4 into one script.
6	Arguments	Print line count of a file.
7	File Sorting	Sort .txt files by size.
8	Multi-File Search	Search for a phrase across .log files.
9	Monitoring	Watch a directory for changes.
10	Boss Battle 2	Create random files, sort by size, archive Victory files.
11	Disk Usage	Check usage vs. threshold.
12	Config Parsing	Read key=value pairs.
13	Backup Rotation	Keep the last 5 backups.
14	Interactive Menu	Menu for disk space, uptime, users.
15	Boss Battle 3	Menu-based script with backups + config parsing.
The 4 Core Bash Tasks

Outside the Arena, I also tackled 4 fundamental Bash exercises:

Basic Arithmetic – Perform +, -, ×, ÷ on two inputs.

File Operations – Create, write, and read files.

Conditionals – Check if a file is readable, writable, or executable.

Backup Script – Copy .txt files to a backup folder.
