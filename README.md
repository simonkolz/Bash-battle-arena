# **Bash Battle Arena ‚öîÔ∏è**  

Welcome to the **Bash Battle Arena** ‚Äì a training ground where I sharpen my Bash scripting skills through **hands-on DevOps challenges**.  

This repository contains:  
- **15 progressive levels** of Bash challenges (the Arena).  
- **Boss Battles** every 5th level to combine multiple skills.  
- **4 standalone Bash scripting tasks** focused on real-world automation.  

It‚Äôs both a **learning journey** and a **portfolio showcase** of my scripting knowledge.

## **Why Bash Battle?**  
Working through these challenges has been both **practical and fun**.  

Bash scripting may look simple, but writing scripts that are **clean, efficient, and reliable** takes practice. The Arena forced me to think like a DevOps engineer: not just ‚ÄúDoes this work?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúIs this the best way to solve the problem?‚Äù.  

This project highlights:  
- Strong foundations in **Bash scripting** (loops, conditionals, argument parsing).  
- Experience in **automation, monitoring, and file operations**.  
- The discipline of **documenting and sharing** technical work professionally.

All progress is tracked here: **[simonkolz/Bash-battle/arena](https://github.com/simonkolz/Bash-battle/tree/main/arena)**  

This serves as both:  
- A **log of my learning journey**.  
- A **portfolio of DevOps automation skills** for recruiters and employers.
